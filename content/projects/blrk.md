## Overview

Saleen is the leader in designing and manufacturing American performance sports cars and supercars. With 40+ years of experience developing custom cars with the Ford Motor Company, Saleen is now fundraising to bring the Saleen S1 to market.

With 300+ racing wins, Saleen has been featured in Road & Track, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Robb Report, Motor Trend, Muscle Cars and Trucks, Auto Evolution, Teslarati, Hot Cars, Fox News, and more.

The Luxury-Premium Performance market was $617 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach over $1 trillion by 2030. Saleen hopes to capitalize on this growth by continuing the Saleen Original Series.

While the Saleen S1 is brand new, the Saleen business is far from new. The company has a 40-year history with the Ford Motor Company, where they design, develop, manufacture, and sell high-performance vehicles based on the chassis of the Ford Mustang, Ford F-150, and new Ford Bronco. While these Ford vehicles are part of the Saleen Signature Series, we are continuing our Saleen Original Series with the Saleen S1, a two-seater sports car entirely designed and developed by Saleen Automotive.
